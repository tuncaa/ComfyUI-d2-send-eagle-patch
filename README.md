# D2 Send Eagle

[English][<a href="README_ja.md">日本語</a>][<a href="README_zh.md">繁体中文</a>]

This is a custom node for ComfyUI that sends generated images to the image management software [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/).

It's an extension of an existing custom node [ComfyUI-send-eagle-slim](https://github.com/shingo1228/ComfyUI-send-eagle-slim), modified to my preferences. Thanks to Shingo.T for creating the original excellent custom node.
